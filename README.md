## What's this?

I got tired of hitting Ctrl+S in Atom and switching to the browser; at the same time I'm not into "auto-saving". So I quickly created [Tailwind Fiddle](https://tailwind.unravel.eu/) and had a lot of fun doing that. No more Ctrl+S to design those Tailwind-powered components :100:. Want to see how a Tailwind component looks like? Just paste it [here](https://tailwind.unravel.eu/)!
